## Baddify

Baddify turns your name into a Breaking Bad style name, which should make sense if you are familiar with the show and its opening credits. I got this idea from a Google engineer, though I cannot remember his name for proper attribution. This is the result of a interview question he used to ask potential candidates. I wanted to make my own version just to see how long it took. I spent about 20 minutes on the javascript, and another 20 or so toying with the CSS.
